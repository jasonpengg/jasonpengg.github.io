                            <p>The Ontario Engineering Competition (OEC) is an annual three-day competition that brings together more than 300 of the province’s brightest engineering students. After placing first at the university level, my team and I represented McMaster at OEC 2025, where we placed 3rd in the consulting category. Our task was to design a detailed solution to the large-scale engineering problem of traffic congestion in a hypothetical Canadian city. We outcompeted a handful of strong teams, with strategic planning, strong leadership and effective problem solving. My experience with OEC strengthened my passion for cross-collaborative engineering design and gave me experience working under pressure with real world constraints.</p>
